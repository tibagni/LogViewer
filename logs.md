# Logs

LogViewer will automatically merge and sort all the log files you open and present it to you in a chronological way. The Logs View is divided in 2: the "All Logs" View and the "Filtered Logs" View. The first one will contain all the logs from all the opened files, and the secon one will contain only the log lines that matches one or more of the applied filters identified by the filter color. This is a great way to only read what matters (Filtered Logs View) without losing the context of what happened (All Logs View)

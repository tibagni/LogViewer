# Filter Editor
![Filter Editor](../images/filter-editor.png)
Filters are an essential piece of Log Viewer. Your filters can be as simple as a single Word or as complex as you want using regex. They can be case sensitive or not.

You can define a name and a color for each filter so you can easily differentiate them when applied to your set of logs.

# Regex Editor

Log Viewer comes with a built-in regex editor to help you create complex queries for your filters. Just type your regex on the ‘Regex’ field and it will highlight the text below (which can be anything you want) automatically, so you can see your regex in practice. If your regex has a syntax error, Regex Editor will tell that to you by turning the ‘Regex’ field red.
